  image_url: raiany.jpg
  bio: Raiany spends most of her time thinking about how converging technologies will transform governments and human nature in the coming decades. She's particularly interested in why secular humans narrate aging as a net-positive, teleological phenomenon—and in the negative effects of this narrative on economies and societies.\n\nHer work has appeared in The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Forbes, Quillette, The Hill, and ABC, and she is currently a Consultant for the Healthspan XPRIZE. With support from Amaranth, Raiany is working on a non-fiction book aimed at shifting the ethics, policy and philosophy of aging research. Alongside the Federation of American Scientists, she is also developing new policy narratives for aging, building on the bipartisan support for multi-billion-dollar governmental plans to democratize effective care and therapies for older adults as a foundation for common ground and progress in the aging field.
